								<p>""Growing up on a working farm taught me the value of hard work. We plowed the land and reaped the rewards with fresh vegetables and fruits. In high school I hacked into the school's main server using a brute force attack, I showed the teacher what I had done in an attempt to show that my school was not protecting itself or its students. The only action the school took was for me to be suspended. As further punishment, I was enrolled in vo-tech to take computer network technology while completing my junior year of high school. With 9/11 I enlisted in the Army and became an NBC specialist for the 1-71 CAV. After returning from Iraq, I worked for a chemical company as their in-house IT Tech before starting to travel the world. I have visited all 50 States and 60 countries learning from different cultures. After multiple cave diving deaths of people close to me, I wrapped up the Wonderland Project and attended Full-Stack Development to learn web and software development."
